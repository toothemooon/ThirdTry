# Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
This project aims to build a personal blog site using SvelteKit, similar to the Tailwind NextJS Starter Blog template (https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/). The site will utilize Supabase for backend services, Tailwind CSS for styling, and DaisyUI for UI components. The goal is to create a modern, responsive blog with clean design and optimal performance.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Adapting NextJS patterns to SvelteKit architecture
2. Setting up and integrating Supabase for content management and authentication
3. Implementing data fetching strategies in SvelteKit (versus Next.js)
4. Creating a responsive, accessible design using Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI
5. Implementing features like:
   - MDX/Markdown rendering for blog posts
   - Code syntax highlighting
   - Tag-based organization
   - Search functionality
   - Pagination
   - Comments system (if desired)
   - Analytics integration
6. Optimizing performance and SEO

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
I've successfully installed the Supabase CLI and connected to the existing Supabase project. Here's what was accomplished:

1. Installed Supabase CLI with Homebrew (was already installed: version 2.22.6)
2. Logged in to Supabase using `supabase login`
3. Initialized a Supabase project in the current directory with `supabase init`
4. Linked the local project to the remote Supabase instance with `supabase link --project-ref yqoigziaqznsenpxkkwx`
5. Created a Supabase client in the SvelteKit app:
   - Added a `supabaseClient.ts` file in the lib directory
   - Installed `@supabase/supabase-js` package
   - Created a test page to demonstrate both client-side and server-side data fetching
   - Updated homepage with a link to the test page

I've also fixed the connection issue with the test page:

1. Used the Supabase REST API to discover existing tables in the database: `curl -X GET "https://yqoigziaqznsenpxkkwx.supabase.co/rest/v1/" -H "apikey: ANON_KEY"`
2. Found an existing table called `test_items`
3. Added a test item to the table to verify write capabilities
4. Updated the client and server code to use the correct table name instead of the placeholder 'your_table_name'
5. Verified the connection is now working with both client-side and server-side data fetching

Additionally, I've optimized the Supabase test page by removing redundant client-side data fetching and only using server-side loading, which is more efficient.

I've also created a reusable Supabase connection test utility:
1. Created `test_connection.js` script that:
   - Tests querying the test_items table
   - Tests inserting data into the table
   - Provides clear formatted output with success/error messages
   - Shows sample data from the database
2. Added an npm script `test:supabase` to package.json for easy execution
3. Made the script executable with `chmod +x`

I've successfully merged project folders:
1. Copied the `supabase` folder from the root directory into the `myapp` directory
2. Copied the `.gitattributes` file into the `myapp` directory
3. Created a root `package.json` file with scripts that forward to the `myapp` directory
4. Restored the missing `+layout.svelte` file which was causing application errors

Now the project structure is more organized:
- The `myapp` directory contains the SvelteKit application and all related files
- The root directory has a `package.json` with scripts that make it easy to run commands from the root

To run this test anytime, you can use:
```
npm run test:supabase
```

To check your database and tables using the Supabase REST API:
1. List all records in a table:
   ```
   curl -X GET "https://yqoigziaqznsenpxkkwx.supabase.co/rest/v1/table_name?select=*" -H "apikey: YOUR_API_KEY"
   ```
2. Create a new record:
   ```
   curl -X POST "https://yqoigziaqznsenpxkkwx.supabase.co/rest/v1/table_name" -H "apikey: YOUR_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"field": "value"}'
   ```
3. Update a record:
   ```
   curl -X PATCH "https://yqoigziaqznsenpxkkwx.supabase.co/rest/v1/table_name?id=eq.1" -H "apikey: YOUR_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"field": "new_value"}'
   ```
4. Delete a record:
   ```
   curl -X DELETE "https://yqoigziaqznsenpxkkwx.supabase.co/rest/v1/table_name?id=eq.1" -H "apikey: YOUR_API_KEY"
   ```

For enhanced security in a production environment, I recommend:
1. Using environment variables instead of hardcoded credentials
2. Setting up Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase
3. Implementing proper authentication for protected routes

## Lessons
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using the -force git command
- When installing new packages, check for vulnerabilities in the output and address them if necessary
- For production, never hardcode API keys and URLs; always use environment variables
- When connecting to a database, always verify table names first instead of assuming placeholder names will work
- Use Supabase REST API to explore your database structure when CLI commands aren't working
- Consider server-side data loading instead of duplicating API calls on the client side for better performance
- Keep project files organized in a logical directory structure to avoid confusion
