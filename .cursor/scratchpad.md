# Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
This project aims to build a personal blog site using SvelteKit, similar to the Tailwind NextJS Starter Blog template (https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/). The site will utilize Supabase for backend services, Tailwind CSS for styling, and DaisyUI for UI components. The goal is to create a modern, responsive blog with clean design and optimal performance.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Adapting NextJS patterns to SvelteKit architecture
2. Setting up and integrating Supabase for content management and authentication
3. Implementing data fetching strategies in SvelteKit (versus Next.js)
4. Creating a responsive, accessible design using Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI
5. Implementing features like:
   - MDX/Markdown rendering for blog posts
   - Code syntax highlighting
   - Tag-based organization
   - Search functionality
   - Pagination
   - Comments system (if desired)
   - Analytics integration
6. Optimizing performance and SEO
