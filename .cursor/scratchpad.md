# Supabase SvelteKit Integration Project

## Background and Motivation
This project involves connecting a SvelteKit frontend to a Supabase backend. We've successfully established the connection between the frontend and Supabase, created database tables, implemented Row Level Security, and set up a test interface. However, there are still issues with client-side/server-side code separation in the current implementation.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Client-side vs Server-side separation**: SvelteKit enforces strict separation between client and server code, similar to Next.js's approach. Currently, we're seeing errors related to importing server-side Supabase client in client-side code, despite having updated our components to use the client-side instance.

2. **Module graph contamination**: The error suggests that somewhere in our dependency tree, there's still a reference to the server-side Supabase client that's being pulled into the client-side code. This needs to be fully isolated.

3. **Environment setup**: The project structure includes a frontend directory within the main repository, causing confusion when running npm commands. We need to ensure commands are always run from the frontend directory.

4. **A11y warnings**: Form labels need proper associations with their input elements. We've added `for/id` attributes but some warnings persist.

5. **File structure organization**: We need to properly structure the application to follow SvelteKit conventions for server/client code separation.

## Server/Client Code Separation Principles
Based on modern web framework practices (similar to Next.js):

1. **Network Boundary**: There's a conceptual line that separates the server and client environments. In SvelteKit, this is enforced by preventing direct imports from server directories into client code.

2. **Server Components**: Server-only code should be completely isolated and only its results (not the code itself) should be passed to the client, typically through API endpoints or server load functions.

3. **Data Fetching Patterns**: For secure data operations:
   - Server-side operations should use server-only clients with full database access
   - Client-side operations should use either:
     - API endpoints that hide sensitive logic
     - Public clients with restricted permissions

4. **Prevention of Sensitive Data Exposure**: The framework prevents server imports in client code to avoid accidentally exposing sensitive information like API keys or database credentials.

## Identified Issues and Analysis

Based on our code analysis, we found that:

1. The `frontend/src/lib/utils/supabase-check.ts` utility imports the server-side Supabase client, which could be causing issues if any client code is trying to use this utility.

2. The main dependency problem appears to be in how SvelteKit is resolving module dependencies during bundling.

3. We need to restructure our code to ensure proper client/server separation:
   - Server-side code should only be used in server components and API endpoints
   - Client-side code should not import any server-side code, even transitively
   - All client-side operations should go through API endpoints or use client-side only utilities

4. Currently the `+layout.ts` file uses direct Supabase client initialization, which is correct for client-side code.

5. The `npm run dev` command needs to be run from the frontend directory, not the root project directory.

## Next Steps for Executor

1. **Create a dedicated client-side supabase-check utility**:
   - Create the directory structure: `mkdir -p frontend/src/lib/client/utils`
   - Create a new file `frontend/src/lib/client/utils/supabase-check.ts` that imports from `$lib/client/supabase` instead
   - Make sure the interface matches the server version but safe for client usage
   - Update any client code to use this utility instead

2. **Add a 'use client' directive to client-only files**:
   - Add an explicit marker at the top of client-side utility files: `// @client-only`
   - This will help us track which files should never import server code

3. **Create a server-only marker for server code**:
   - Add a comment at the top of server-side files: `// @server-only`
   - This helps maintain clear boundaries between server and client code

4. **Fix existing import errors**:
   - Run the app from the frontend directory: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
   - Fix any specific import errors that persist by checking console output

5. **Add SvelteKit-specific environment handling**:
   - Use environment specific imports for utilities that might be used in both environments

## Project Status Board
- [ ] Create client-side version of supabase-check utility
- [ ] Add client/server markers to appropriate files 
- [ ] Fix remaining import errors
- [ ] Run app from frontend directory
- [ ] Verify app works correctly with no import errors

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
- We've created a client-side Supabase instance
- We've set up API endpoints
- We've updated the page component to use client-side Supabase
- We've fixed accessibility issues with form labels
- We've identified the specific issue causing server imports in client code
- We need to create a client-side version of the supabase-check utility

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
*To be filled by the Executor*

## Lessons
- SvelteKit strictly enforces client/server code separation
- Server-side code (including Supabase server client) cannot be imported into client-side code, even indirectly
- Remember to run npm commands from the correct directory (frontend)
- Always associate form labels with inputs using for/id attributes
- Modern web frameworks enforce a clear network boundary between server and client code
- When using a11y labels, ensure they're properly associated with form controls
- Package.json must exist in the directory where npm commands are run
- Utility functions should be created in both client and server versions if needed in both contexts
